# Keyboard layouts for Swedish (for Windows)
This layout consists of two different variants. They are primarily intended for 104-key ANSI keyboards but should work fine on 105-key ISO layouts too. 

It is based on the standard US layout but with Swedish characters added, as well as other characters that are included in the standard Swedish layout but not in the US layout. I avoided as many duplicates as possible with the exception of characters that are already duplicated in the standard Swedish layout and dead keys. 

## US-SE variant
The base and Shift layer is standard US layout. The AltGr and AltGr + Shift contains characters from the Swedish layout.
